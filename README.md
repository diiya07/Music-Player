This is a simple music player application built with Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Pygame library for handling music playback. The application allows users to:

Load a music file from their local system.

Play, pause, and stop the music.

Control the music playback easily using intuitive buttons.

The project demonstrates the integration of basic GUI elements with audio handling, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for music playback.
